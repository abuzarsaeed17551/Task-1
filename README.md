how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand data trends and distributions. Load the dataset using pandas.
● Print the shape, column names, and the first few rows using .head().
● Use .info() and .describe() for summary statistics.
● Visualize the dataset:
○ Create a scatter plot to show relationships between features.
○ Use histograms to show value distributions.
○ Use box plots to identify outliers.
